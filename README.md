## Project aims

- Analyze the datasets and select the best predictors.
- Implement the gradient descent algorithm.
- Test our implementation for a varying number of iteration steps, learning rate, train/test ratio to estimate their effect on the model
- Evaluation for each scenario of the goodness of fit and having a better understanding of the behaviors of multiple linear regression
